# Rails Testing Exercises / Testing Fundamentals Testing Activerecord

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Rails Testing Exercises](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/rails-testing-exercises) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

Testing an ActiveRecord model is similar to testing a simple Ruby object, but you'll need to go through the public ActiveRecord API to test your functionality. For example, you'll need to run `save` or `valid?` to generate error messages from your validations.

In this exercise, you'll write an RSpec model test to verify a simple validation.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/testing-fundamentals-testing-activerecord.git
    cd testing-fundamentals-testing-activerecord
    bin/setup

1. Edit `spec/models/person_spec.rb`.
2. Write a spec to ensure that the model is invalid without a `first_name`.
3. Make sure your specs are passing by running `rake.`
