# Rails Testing Exercises / Testing Fundamentals Write An Integration Test

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Rails Testing Exercises](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/rails-testing-exercises) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

Writing tests for classes and models is useful, but eventually you'll want to make sure that all of your classes, views, and configuration are working together correctly. To do this, you'll write an integration test, which focuses on objects working together. These tests are very useful for catching bugs.

In this example, we'll be using Capybara to write an integration test. Capybara allows you to simulate user actions on your site, such as visiting URLs and clicking on links, so that you can go through features the way a user would and verify that the outcome is correct.

This exercise contains a model, controllers, and views which allow users to add and view people. You'll use Capybara to write an integration test which verifies that a user can add a person using the form.

Here are some examples of methods which you may want to use:

``` ruby
# Visit a page
visit root_url

# Fill in a text field
fill_in "Email", with: "user@example.com"

# Click on a link
click_link "About"

# Click on a button
click_button "Save"

# Check for text on the page
expect(page).to have_content("Thank you")
```

You can find more examples of using Capybara in the [documentation](http://rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara).

## Instructions
