## Exercise Intro

Writing tests for existing code is a good way to learn RSpec, Capybara, and other tools, but in the real world, you'll usually write tests as you add production code.

In this exercise, you'll add enhance a small Rails applications by adding the ability edit existing people. You'll implement the necessary actions and views in the Rails application, writing tests as you go.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/testing-fundamentals-write-a-feature-with-tests.git
    cd testing-fundamentals-write-a-feature-with-tests
    bin/setup

Add `edit` and `update` actions to `PeopleController` so that users can edit existing people. Add the following tests:

* An integration test which uses Capybara to verify the new feature.
* A controller test which uses RSpec to verify the new controller actions.

Make sure your tests are passing by running `rake`.
